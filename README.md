**#Project - 1 Analyzing Students' Mental Health (11/05/2024 - Tuesday)**
This project aims to determine if attending university in a foreign country impacts mental health for international students. Specifically, it explores whether international students face higher mental health risks than the general population, with a focus on whether factors like social connectedness (a sense of belonging) and acculturative stress (challenges in adapting to a new culture) predict mental health challenges such as depression. Additionally, the code assesses whether the length of stay in the host country contributes to these mental health outcomes. The goal is to compare the results with findings from a 2018 Japanese university survey.
